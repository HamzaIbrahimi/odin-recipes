HTML recipe project

In this project, I will be demonstrating what I have learned so far from TOP. This is the first project which will give me the opportunity to show the skills I have learned from undertaking HTML foundations. 

I will build a very basic website using HTML. It will not look pretty, but it is certainly one small step towards my bigger aim.
