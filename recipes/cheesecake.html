        <h4><u>And Here's How to Make Them</u></h4>    
            <ol>
               <li> Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180˚C). Grease a 10-inch (25 cm) springform pan with nonstick spray. Line the inside edges of the pan with parchment paper.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>In the bowl of a food processor, combine the graham crackers, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and the melted butter. Pulse to combine until the texture is similar to wet sand.</li>
                    <br>
                 <li>Press the graham cracker crumbs into the prepared pan, using a measuring cup to compact in even layer.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes, until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature.</li>
                    <br>
                <li> Once cool, line the sides of the springform pan with parchment paper.</li>
                    <br>
               <li>In a large bowl, combine the cream cheese, remaining 2 cups (400 G) of sugar, and the salt. Using an electric hand mixer, blend until well-combined and fluffy.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Add the heavy cream and beat to incorporate.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Add the sour cream, flour, salt, and vanilla bean seeds, and beat to combine.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Add the eggs, 1 at a time, and mix until fully combined, making sure not to over-beat. The mixture should be smooth and creamy.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Pour the cream cheese mixture into the cooled crust.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Wrap the outside of the springform pan tightly with foil and place the pan in a large baking dish. Fill the dish with 1 inch (2 cm) of boiling water.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Gently transfer the baking dish to the oven and bake for 1 hour.</li>
                    <br>
               <li>Without opening the oven door, turn off the heat and let the cheesecake rest for 1 hour.</li>
                    <br>
               <li>Remove the springform pan from the baking dish and unwrap the foil. Run a paring knife gently around the outside of the cheesecake to loosen it from the sides of the pan.</li>
                    <br>
               <li>Cover the pan with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator overnight.</li>
                    <br>
               <li>Remove the cheesecake from the refrigerator and release the springform pan. Remove the parchment paper lining.</li>
                     <br>
               <li>Top with fresh berries, if desired.</li>
                    <br>               
               <li>Dip a knife into hot water for clean slices, then slice and serve.</li>
            </ol>
