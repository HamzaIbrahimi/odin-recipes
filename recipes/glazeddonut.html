                    <li> In a medium bowl, add the milk, sugar, and yeast, stirring to combine.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> In a separate medium bowl, add the butter, eggs, and vanilla extract, stirring to combine.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li>  Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, until smooth.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Gently poke the dough with a finger--the dough should bounce back up from the indentation.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Place the dough in a large bowl, and lightly coat the dough with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Let the dough rise in a warm place for an hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Take the dough out and knead on a floured surface for 5 minutes until smooth. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Place the dough in an oiled bowl and repeat with rise overnight in refrigerator.</li>
                    <br>
                     <li> Roll out the dough on a floured surface until ¼ inch (6 mm) thick.</li>
                     <br>
                    <li>Cut out the doughnuts and donut holes with a cookie cutter and piping tip.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Melt enough shortening over medium heat to come up just 2 inches (5 cm) up on the side of a heavy frying pan. Heat the shortening to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Fry the donuts and donut holes for 45 seconds on each side, or until golden brown.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>In a bowl, combine the powdered sugar, dry milk powder, vanilla extract and hot water until smooth.</li> 
                    <br>
                    <li>Strain the glaze through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Dunk the donuts in the glaze or drizzle the glaze on top.</li>
